# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
### Purpose 
V. Isualize and her company tasked us with creating visualizations to represent the weekly fare average by community type. We compared three different types of communities including urban, rural, and suburban. We then extracted a date range to view, and create a line graph to compare community types. 
### Tasks to Complete
- Isolate the averages per community including:
    1. Ride count
    2. Driver count
    3. Fare in USD
    4. The average fare per ride
    5. The average fare per driver
 - Put the data into a chart
 - Create specifications for date range and isolating by week
 - Create a line graph to show the results
### Resources 
 - Data source: ride_data.csv and city_data.csv
 - Software: Python 3.6.1, Matplotlib, Jupyter notebook, pandas
## PyBer Analysis Results
There are fairly stark difference between the different kinds of communities. Where Rural has quite low averages, urban areas have quite high averages. This is the result of mutilple factors; there are fewer drivers in urban communities and fewer people to need rides so it is not surprising that the cost is so much lower, even though the cost per ride is more expensive, but that is following the rules of supply and demand, not enough drivers per community would cause a rise in cost. Whereas the overall fare cost in urban is quite high, the average cost per ride is much lower than rural rides. Interestingly, urban and rural seem to follow the same up and down trends, though not exact; whereas suburban has bigger dips and seems to have more overall instability. It woudl be interesting to watch the rest of the month so see how the differnt season affect ridesharing companies
## Summary 
This graph shows total fares, this is a good way to get overall data for profit, but I think it would be valuable to have a different graph exlporing the average individual costs of rides. It would also serve to calculate these averages on the bases of per capita, again while general profit is important, it isn't easy to see actual trends between them, so controlling for population would serve them greatly. I would also look to see if there are areas where they have lowered or raised the prices intentionally to see if this has any effect on the number of rides given. Finally I would look at all of the months in a year and see if there are trends over the course of the months with weather, and maybe add in phase change lines for holidays or big events, like the superbowl.
